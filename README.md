This project template is a demonstration for the RepCo workshop.

## Usage

Click "Use this template" at the top of this page to create a new repository with the same folder structure.

## Installation

## Project Structure

The project structure distinguishes three kinds of folders:
- read-only (RO): not edited by either code or researcher
- human-writeable (HW): edited by the researcher only.
- project-generated (PG): folders generated when running the code; these folders can be deleted or emptied and will be completely reconstituted as the project is run.
